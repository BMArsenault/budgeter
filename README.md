# budgeter

## Description

This is a PWA application that allows you to track your budget while online as well as offline.  As a user, I want to be able to track my finances by deposits and withdrawls, whether I am offline or not so that I know how much money is in my account.  This app is what you need to keep track of that for you!

## Installation

Enter "npm install" in the command line to download all dependencies.
